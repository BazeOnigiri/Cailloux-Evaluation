# Cailloux Game - Phaser.js Evaluation Project

This repository contains a full 2D game project developed using JavaScript and the Phaser.js framework.

It features a multi-scene structure, including a main menu, a core game loop, and an end-of-game screen.

The game uses Tiled map data and includes core mechanics like player movement, collision detection, and handling various assets (rocks, explosions, healing).

This project served as a comprehensive evaluation demonstrating proficiency in game development using modern web technologies.
